        <h2>Who is Mark Ryden</h2>
        <p>Photo: Ann Cutting, 2000</p>
        <p>Mark Ryden is an American painter known for the genre of art that he dubbed "Pop Surrealism" in which he blended elements of popculture with surrealist aspects in order to comment on issues that he saw within society. "Ryden's vocabulary ranges from cryptic to cute, treading a fine line between nostalgic cliché and resonating archetypes. Seduced by his infinitely detailed and meticulously glazed surfaces, the viewer is confronted with the juxtaposition of childhood innocence and the mysterious recesses of the soul." (Ryden, 2014)
